# Getting Juno

Getting Juno takes a couple of simple steps and just a few minutes. Follow this and you'll be running Julia code in no time!

## Getting Julia

First, download Julia (command line version) for your platform from the [downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

Then:

#### On Windows

1. Run the downloaded installer, using the default settings.

#### On OS X

1. Double-click the downloaded disk image to load it.
2. Drag the Julia-0.X.Y app onto the Applications folder shortcut.

#### On Linux

1. Unzip the downloaded folder and place it in your home directory.
2. Make sure to have dependencies curl and cmake installed.

## Getting Atom & Juno

Download, install and open [Atom](https://atom.io). If you have it already, make sure it's up to date (version 1.23+).

In Atom, go to Settings (<kbd>Ctrl ,</kbd>, or <kbd>Cmd ,</kbd> on OS X) and go to the "Install" panel.

Type `uber-juno` into the search box and hit enter. Click the install button on the package of the same name.

Atom will then set up Juno for you, installing the required Atom and Julia packages. Once the setup is done you're good to go!

## Notes & Troubleshooting

This setup works by installing the collection of modules and plugins that together make up Juno. For more information see [here](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client/issues/186#issuecomment-224560622).

If you have any issues with this setup, please do report it here or at [Juno Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/tools/juno). We'll do our best to help you get going.
