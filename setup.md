# Getting Juno

## Getting Julia

First, download Julia (command line version) for your platform from the [downloads page](http://julialang.org/downloads/).

Then:

#### On Windows

1. Run the downloaded installer, using the default settings.

#### On OS X

1. Double-click the downloaded disk image to load it.
2. Drag the Julia-0.X.Y app onto the Applications folder shortcut.

#### On Linux

1. Unzip the downloaded folder and place it in your home directory.

## Getting Atom

Download, install and open [Atom](https://atom.io).

In Atom, go to Settings (<kbd>Ctrl ,</kbd>, or <kbd>Cmd ,</kbd> on OS X) and go to the "Install" panel.

Type `uber-juno` into the search box and hit enter. Click the install button on the package of the same name.

Atom will then set up Juno for you, installing the required Atom and Julia packages. Once the setup is done you're good to go!
